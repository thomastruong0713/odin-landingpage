Odin Project: Landing Page

A beginner project from "The Odin Project: Foundations Course" where I will attempt to re-create a site design that they have provided me. Doing this will have shown that I now have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Flexbox.

Post-Project Reflection: After completing the project I feel that I am much more comfortable with all the basics of HTML and CSS. This project also showed me that planning ahead and structuring my workflow section by section is important for myself and makes things much more digestable. Overall I had a good time with this project and would say that it hit the sweet spot in terms of difficulty.
